## What is this respository

左耳朵耗子倡导的 ARTS, 每日完成下面的活动

| Activity      | Explanation          |
| :------------ | :------------------- |
| **A**lgorithm | 完成一道算法题       |
| **R**eview    | 评论一片文章         |
| **T**ip       | 生活和工作中的小技巧 |
| **S**hare     | 分享自己当日所得     |

## When To Do

1. Complete the **algorithm** during my lunch time.
2. The **review** part can be splited in two parts. Do the reading in the morning on my way to work, and actually write the review in English between 6:00pm and 6:30pm.
3. The **tip** part can be done in my mind on my way home per day
4. The Share could be a little tricky. But I think I can still write a markdown file
