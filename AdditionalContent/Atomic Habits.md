《Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones》

I found this book from a popular chinese read recommendation list. At first I did not plan to spend much time on reading it, but after three chapters. I realize that it worth reading, and it could be a solution helping me out of my daily struggle. Now I recommend this book to pepople around me, including my friends, my colleges, and my partner.
